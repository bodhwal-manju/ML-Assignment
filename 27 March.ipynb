    "Ans: R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s) in a linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit of the model to the data. It is calculated as the ratio of the explained variance to the total variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared = explained variance / total variance\n",

    "The explained variance is the variation in the dependent variable that is accounted for by the independent variable(s), while the total variance is the variation in the dependent variable that is not explained by the independent variable(s).\n",

    "Ans: Adjusted R-squared is typically used when comparing multiple regression models that have different numbers of predictors. This is because regular R-squared tends to increase as more predictors are added to a model, regardless of whether or not the predictors actually improve the model's predictive power. Adjusted R-squared, on the other hand, takes into account the number of predictors in the model, penalizing models that have many predictors that don't improve the model's performance. Therefore, adjusted R-squared is more appropriate when comparing models with different numbers of predictors, as it provides a more accurate measure of a model's predictive power relative to the number of predictors in the model.\n",

    "Advantages of using RMSE, MSE, and MAE as evaluation metrics in regression analysis include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. RMSE and MSE both take into account the distance between the predicted values and the actual values, making them more robust to outliers compared to MAE. In other words, the presence of a few extreme values will not have a significant impact on the overall error rate of the model.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of using RMSE, MSE, and MAE as evaluation metrics in regression analysis include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. RMSE and MSE can be sensitive to outliers if they are squared, leading to artificially high error rates. This can be mitigated by using robust regression techniques or by using MAE instead.\n",

    "Ans: Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization is a method used in linear regression to reduce the effect of irrelevant or less important features. It works by adding a penalty term to the loss function that forces the coefficients of some of the features to be reduced to zero. This results in a simpler model with only the most important features included, making it easier to interpret and potentially improving its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lasso regularization is represented by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss function with L1 regularization = Sum of squares of residuals + 位 * Sum of absolute values of coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, 位 is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of the penalty term. The higher the value of 位, the more the coefficients are shrunk towards zero, leading to sparser models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, Ridge regularization also adds a penalty term to the loss function but uses the sum of squares of the coefficients instead of the sum of absolute values. This means that Ridge regression tends to keep all the features in the model, albeit with smaller coefficients, instead of eliminating some of them entirely as Lasso does.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ridge regularization is represented by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss function with L2 regularization = Sum of squares of residuals + 位 * Sum of squares of coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "When deciding whether to use Lasso or Ridge regularization, it is important to consider the characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis. Lasso regularization is more appropriate when there are many features in the dataset and only a few of them are relevant to the outcome variable, as it can help identify and  remove the irrelevant ones. It is also useful when the model is expected to be sparse, i.e., when only a few predictors are expected to be important.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Ridge regularization is more suitable when there are many features that are all potentially relevant to the outcome variable, as it can help stabilize the coefficients and reduce the impact of multicollinearity. It is also useful when the goal is to improve the overall predictive performance of the model rather than selecting only the most important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Lasso and Ridge regularization are both effective techniques for reducing the impact of irrelevant features in linear regression models, but they differ in their approach and are more appropriate in different situations."

    "Ans: Regularized linear models help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the cost function that discourages the model from relying too heavily on any one feature or combination of features. The penalty term increases as the magnitude of the model coefficients grows larger, which encourages the model to prioritize simpler solutions that use fewer features. By doing so, the model can generalize better to new, unseen data.\n",

If we train a linear regression model without regularization, it may fit the training data well but overfit by relying too heavily on certain features, such as location. This can lead to poor performance on new data, as the model is too specialized to the training data.\n",

However, in some cases, certain features may be more important than others and should not be penalized as heavily. In these cases, other feature selection techniques may be more appropriate.\n",
